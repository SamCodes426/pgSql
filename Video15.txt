============================================ PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINTS =====================================================

CREATE TABLE products(
product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
name text,
price numeric
);


PRIMARY KEY will not store the null value and it has to be always UNIQUE





PRIMARY KEY constraint using multiple columns

CREATE TABLE example(
a integer,
b integer,
c integer,
PRIMARY KEY(a,c)
);



PRIMARY KEY features

> adding a primary key creates a unique B-tree index automatically.
> the primary key columns are forced to be not null.


TABLE CONSTRAINTS: 

> a table can have only one primary key.
multiple unique and not null constraints are allowd, but only one can defined as the primary key.

BEST PRACTICES: 

realational databese theory recommends every table have a primary key for data integrity.
postgreSql does not enforce this rule, but it is generally good prcatice to follow.


USAGE AND BENEFITS: 
> PRIMARY KEY help document table structures .
essential for client applications (e.g., GUIs) to uniquely identify and modify rows .
used by the database for features like defining default target columns for foreign key references .
