constraining the values 
for example ---> constraining the user to put negative value as the price of a pen

types of constraints

> check constraints     (check the kind of value we are providing)
> not-null constraints  (restricts the null cell)
> unique constraints    (makes sure if the value is unique everytime)
> primary keys          (combination of not-null and unique)
> foriegn keys          (to maintain the data integrity among the tables)
