A SQL-standard way to define auto-incrementing columns

GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY

create table people (
id bigint generated always as identity,
name text,
address text
);


insert into people(name,address) values ('samar','chattarpur');         (THIS WILL WORK)
insert into people (id,name,address) values (default,'b','dod');        (THIS WILL NOT WORK)
insert into people (id,name,address) values (4,'c','foo');              (THIS WILL WORK)


GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY

create table people (
id bigint generated by default as identity,
name text,
address text
);

insert into people(name,address) values ('samar','chattarpur');         (THIS WILL WORK)
insert into people (id,name,address) values (default,'b','dod');        (THIS WILL WORK)
insert into people (id,name,address) values (4,'c','foo');              (THIS WILL WORK)
